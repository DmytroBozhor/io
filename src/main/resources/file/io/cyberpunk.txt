Cyberpunk 2077

Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt,
and based on Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop game series. The plot is set in the fictional metropolis of Night City,
California, within the dystopian Cyberpunk universe. The player assumes the role of V (voiced by Gavin Drea/Cherami Leigh),
a mercenary who accidentally gets imbued with a cybernetic "bio-chip" containing an engram of legendary rockstar and
terrorist Johnny Silverhand (voiced by Keanu Reeves). As Johnny's consciousness begins overwriting V's own, the two must
work together to separate and save V's life.

The game's development began following the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine (2016).
The game was developed by a team of around 500 people using the REDengine 4 game engine. CD Projekt launched a new
division in Wrocław, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production.
Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves had a starring role. The original score was
led by Marcin Przybyłowicz, and featured the contributions of several licensed artists. After years of anticipation,
CD Projekt released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 10 December 2020, followed by
PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 15 February 2022.

Cyberpunk 2077 received praise from critics for its narrative, setting, and graphics. However, some of its gameplay
elements received mixed responses while its themes and representation of transgender characters received some criticism.
It was also widely criticized for bugs, particularly in the console versions which suffered from performance problems.
Sony removed it from the PlayStation Store from December 2020 to June 2021 while CD Projekt rectified some of the problems.
CD Projekt became subject to investigations and class-action lawsuits for their perceived attempts at downplaying the
severity of the technical problems before release; these were ultimately cleared with a settlement of US$1.85 million.
By October 2023, the game had sold over 25 million units. An expansion, Phantom Liberty, released for PlayStation 5,
Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on 26 September 2023, which sold 5 million units in 2023.[1] Its total cost to develop and
market (including updates and DLC) is reportedly over $436 million, making it one of the most expensive video games
to develop. A sequel, codenamed "Project Orion", was announced in October 2022.

Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing game[2] played from a first-person perspective as V,[3] a mercenary whose
voice,[4] face, hairstyle, body type and modifications, background, and clothing are customisable. There are also five
attributes (Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical, and Cool) that can be customized to suit the player's gameplay style.

The gameplay is flexible: the three primary play styles are Netrunner (hacking), Techie (machinery), and Solo (combat).
V has a number of maneuvers to reposition in combat, including sprinting, taking cover, double-jumping, and sliding;[5][6]
many of these abilities can be unlocked or upgraded through cyberware implants installed by a "ripperdoc".[7]
Weapon use increases accuracy and reloading speed, which are reflected in character animations.[8] Equipment, such as
weapons and armor, is governed by a coloured tier system[9] and is split into melee and ranged options.
Melee strikes can be dealt with close-combat weapons.[10][11] There are three types of ranged weapons, all of which can
be customised and modified—Power (with ricocheting bullets), Tech (which penetrates walls and enemies), and Smart (with
homing bullets).[12][13] The game has four types of damage that can be inflicted and resisted—Physical, Thermal,
Electric, and Chemical.[14][15][16] The game can be completed without killing anyone,[17] with non-lethal options for
weapons and cyberware.[18]

The open world metropolis of Night City consists of six regions: the corporate City Centre, immigrant-inhabited Watson,
luxurious Westbrook, suburban Heywood, gang-infested Pacifica, and industrial Santo Domingo. Its surrounding area, the
Badlands, can also be explored. V navigates these locations on foot (in first-person view) and in vehicles (in either a
third- or first-person view).[7] V owns an apartment and a garage, and can purchase additional apartments throughout the
city.[10] There is a full day-night cycle and dynamic weather, which affects the way non-player characters (NPCs)
behave.[12][19] Depending on the location, law enforcement may be alerted if V commits a crime.[20] Pedestrians are
vulnerable to vehicular collisions.[13] [21] Radio stations are available to listen to.[22] [23] Night City features
many non-English-speaking characters, whose languages can be translated with special implants.[24] V also periodically
uses a "Braindance," a device that allows one to undergo other people's experiences.[25][26]

Edgerunners release

Despite the rampant technical issues that were prevalent during its initial release that affected the game's sales,
Cyberpunk 2077 saw an increase in the number of units sold during the year 2022 of up to 18%, with 94% of the sales being
digital.[228][229] This increase was partially attributed to the release of the Netflix anime series Cyberpunk: Edgerunners,
which garnered positive reviews from both critics and fans,[230][231] and the concurrent release of a game update
which added material from the series in the form of multiple items. CD Projekt Red recognized the success of Edgerunners
having driven sales of Cyberpunk 2077 by stating that "a significant increase in the amount of the Group’s Sales in the
third quarter of 2022 in relation to the reference period was mainly due to a good reception of the Cyberpunk Edgerunner
update 1.6 which preceded the release on Netflix of the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners anime series."[232] The series would again
be referenced in the Cyberpunk 2.0 update that came alongside the Phantom Liberty downloadable content.[233]

Sales
Cyberpunk 2077 received eight million pre-orders on all platforms, of which 74% were digital,[234] and it received more
pre-orders than The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt;[235] one third of PC sales were through GOG.com.[236] It was a best-seller on
Steam in China.[237] CD Projekt Red has stated that digital preorders for the title alone recouped the game's production
cost as well as the game's 2020 marketing cost.[238] According to a CD Projekt investors call, sales saw a drastic decline
four days after release owing to the technical issues present.[239] After the launch, analyst estimations for sales over 12
months fell from 30 million to 25.6 million.[240]

Within twelve hours after its release, the game had over one million concurrent players on Steam.[241] In Japan,
the PlayStation 4 version of Cyberpunk 2077 sold an estimated 104,600 physical units during its debut week, making it
the second best-selling retail game of the week in the country.[242] The game passed 13 million units sold in December
2020.[243][244] It had the biggest digital game launch of all time, selling 10.2 million digital units[245] and
grossed $609 million in digital sales by 31 December 2020.[246] By September 2022, the game had sold over 20 million
units.[247] As of October 2023, it has sold over 25 million units.[248]
